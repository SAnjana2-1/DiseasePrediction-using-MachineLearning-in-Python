# Disease-prediction-using-Machine-Learning in Python
<p>This Machine learning project uses NaiveBayes, DescisionTree and RandomForest as major machine learning algorithms.
<li>
  <ul>The project requires csv files- Testing.csv and Training.csv</ul>
  <ul>The code is been uploaded in code.py</ul>
  <ul>The code is fully based upon python.</ul>
  <ul>We used tkinter for providing GUI .</ul>
