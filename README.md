# Disease-prediction-using-Machine-Learning in Python
<p>This Machine learning project uses NaiveBayes, DescisionTree and RandomForest as major machine learning algorithms.
<ul>
  <li>The project requires csv files- Testing.csv and Training.csv</li>
  <li>The code is been uploaded in code.py</li>
  <li>The code is fully based upon python.</li>
  <li>We used tkinter for providing GUI .</li>
</ul></p>
